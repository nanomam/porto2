    "tiastory": "I also worked at a wooden gift manufacturing company owned by one of my friends. The work primarily involved retouching flaws in customer-submitted images and manipulating colors to match the piece. Occasionally, I added elements to the image based on customer requests. I worked there for approximately 6 months, during which my skills in image manipulation and editing grew significantly. I learned various new techniques for image manipulation. The work pressure during this period also increased my efficiency in handling different design tools and heightened my awareness of customer interactions. 🎨🎁",
